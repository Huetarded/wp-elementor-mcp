## Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] WordPress site with admin access
- [ ] MCP client (like Claude Desktop) installed

## Step 1: Setup the Server

```bash
# Clone or download this repository
cd wp-elementor-mcp

# Run the automated setup

```

The setup script will:

2. Navigate to **Users** â†’ **Profile**
3. Scroll to **Application Passwords** section
4. Enter name: `MCP Server`
5. Click **Add New Application Password**
6. **COPY THE PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY** (you can't see it again!)

## Step 3: Configure Your MCP Client

### For Claude Desktop:

1. Open Claude Desktop settings
2. Find the MCP servers configuration
3. Copy content from `client-config.json` into your config
4. Save and restart Claude Desktop

### For Other MCP Clients:

Use the configuration from `client-config.json` and adapt it for your client.

## Step 4: Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

Your server is now running and ready to accept connections!

## Step 5: First Connection Test

In your MCP client, try this command:

```
Configure WordPress connection with:
- Base URL: https://yoursite.com
- Username: your_username  
- Application Password: AbCd EfGh IjKl MnOp QrSt UvWx
```

If successful, you'll see a connection confirmation message.
